iOS developer code test
Whatâ€™s this?
The task is to build a small iOS application that fetches data from an API of your choosing and presents it in a list.
- The list items should be tappable and, when tapped, should present a detail view.
- The list should contain functionality to filter the results.
- There should be a switch on top of the list to set if the app should be in dark mode or
light mode. All views should follow the rule set by this switch. In this task you are free to use either UIKit or SwiftUI.
Requirements
1. The app must support iOS 16 and work on iPhone 12 or later. iPad support is not required.
2. The app should work when the device is offline (except on first launch) so caching is required.
3. The project should not use any external packages or frameworks other than those native from Apple.
4. The project should include at least one unit test. UI tests are not required, but encouraged.
5. The app should have loading and failure states.
Bonus/Discussion points
It will be seen as a bonus if your components and services/utilities are reusable. Making your code reusable by internal teams and external companies will also be a discussion point during the scheduled presentation of your solution.
Submission instructions
The solution should ideally be submitted in the form of a git repository, either as a link to a public repository or zipped. In a pinch, we can accept a zip file containing just the code and documentation.
